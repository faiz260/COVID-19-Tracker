COVID-19 TRACKER APPLICATION

Technologies used:
    • ReactJS
    • Material UI
    • CSS
    • Leaflet
    • Chart.js
    • Firebase

The main components of the app are:
    1. Info Cards to display the main data i.e. Number of today’s active cases, recovered patients and deaths. On the bottom of the cards total number of cases, recovered and deaths are shown. On clicking the Info Cards it changes the data on the map and the graph.
    2. Dropdown to select a specific country to show it’s data.
    3. Map is integrated to display worldwide data on the map itself by showing red circles. The circles are dynamic whose radius depends upon the numbers it is getting from the api it means the bigger the cases, recovered, deaths are the bigger the circle is. Leaflet is used for the map integration.
    4. Table on the right side of the app is showing worldwide cases. The data is sorted by the number of cases in the countries.
    5. Graph showing worldwide new cases, recovered and deaths by clicking on the Info Cards. Chart.js is used for the graph.

The app is fully mobile responsive. Material UI and CSS are used for styling and Firebase is used to  deploy the app.

So far I’ve created almost 8 projects. I will soon submit all the 12 projects Insha Allah.
